# Data-analysis-exercises
Exercise data projects for my Udemy course - Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp. 
Data used for these projects is mainly from Kaggle public datasets. The themes of the exercises (different libraries e.g. NumPy, pandas, etc. and ML topics) are specified in the title.
